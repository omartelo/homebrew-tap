# Rendered by .github/workflows/release.yml (0.33.0 -> tag, checksums from the
# release's checksums.txt) and pushed to the omartelo/homebrew-tap repository as

#
# A cask, not a formula: only a cask installs an .app into /Applications, which
# is what puts lich in Launchpad, in Spotlight and behind its own icon. The
# binary stanza keeps `lich` on PATH, so the one install still serves both.

  caveats <<~EOS
    lich opens its window in a Chromium-family browser and bundles none: install
    Google Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft Edge or Brave under /Applications.

    That window belongs to the browser, so the Dock shows the browser's icon
    while lich is running; the lich icon is the one in /Applications.

    macOS support is experimental — see the project README.
